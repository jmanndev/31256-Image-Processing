-------

The goal of this project is to align thermographic images taken by the same device over a period of time. These images come in sets of 20, this matlab code takes the first set in the images and aligns the following accordingly.

### Evaluation Metric
We are using Mean Squared Error to calculate the accuracy of the alignment in a quantifiable way.
Two closely aligned images give a MSE of about 200-250 and two unaligned images about 340-380
